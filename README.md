## Description
I built this in order to get a better understanding on Node.js and Javascript. My motivation was to learn more on how to test my files. I learned more about writing prompts and how to structure my information.



## Installation
first you would install inquirer by typing npm i inquirer in the integrated terminal proceeded by typing node index.js and follow the questions.

## Usage
open integrated terminal by right clicking on index.js. once opened type npm i inquierer. To run the tests, you can type npm run test. To have the prompt show and type in new information, type node index.js. To pull it up on a server, right click on team.html and open in browser.
